I think that async programming is more effective way to make operations on files, and fetching http requests.
It gives more control on operations, and by Promises it can be set what and when will happend.

First time I've used Promises in nodeJS when I was setting tasks to build a dist folder for web-fonts, compressed images, scripts, styles etc.
Doing callback functions and forcing other functions to wait, makes operations clean and less buggy.

Naturally Javascript is synchronous and single-threaded language cause it was no need to make it async in browsers.
But it evolved, it started to manage dynamic data width ajax, and also beacome a backend language as a nodeJS where async coding is must have skill to make things work.
